# Email Spam and Ham Detection

This is a spam detection notebook using the Ham and Spam email dataset from SpamAssassin.
The dataset contains over 3,000 emails, with labels indicating whether they are ham or spam. Using machine learning algorithms, I'm exploring ways to accurately classify emails and identify potential spam messages. 

In this notebook, I have primarily tried working with Naive Bayes methodology, and got about 98% accuracy.
